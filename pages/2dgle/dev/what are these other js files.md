the file tree used to be `jrc2.js` and `game.js`

i updated jrc2 so i made two new files: `jrc2MIGRATION.js` and `gameMIGRATION.js`, having the new game code.

ive since moved the old ones to this dev folder, and renamed the new ones back to `jrc2.js` and `game.js`, as well as changed the `index.html` file to match this change.
